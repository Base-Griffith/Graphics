The main issue in implementation was the translation from Pascal into modern C++. We had to look up Pascal's syntax several times. The algorithm itself is also not easy to understand due to it's recursive nature. We also had to spend time understanding OpenGL and FreeGLUT. Both of these are very different from the usual graphics librariesany graphics library we had used till now. Our trees may still go out of screen limits and we don't have the ability to scroll or scale dynamically. Doxygen was relatively straightforward and yielded pretty results fast.
